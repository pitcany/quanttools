### Summary
- Added `src/quanttools/brokers/__init__.py` to declare broker integration package.
- Added `src/quanttools/brokers/robinhood.py` implementing `RobinhoodExecutionHandler`, deferring import of `robin_stocks` until instantiation.
- Added `src/quanttools/brokers/tdameritrade.py` implementing `TDAExecutionHandler`, deferring `tda.auth` import and supporting market & limit orders via `tda-api`.
- Added `tests/brokers/__init__.py` to namespace broker tests.
- Added `tests/brokers/test_robinhood.py` and `tests/brokers/test_tdameritrade.py` with pytest-based unit tests that skip if dependencies are missing.
- Updated `README.md` with examples showing how to use the new broker handlers (Robinhood & TD Ameritrade).

### Testing
- ✅ Manual smoke import of broker modules (no import errors when libraries are absent):
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=src python3 - << 'EOF'
  import quanttools.brokers.robinhood, quanttools.brokers.tdameritrade
  print('OK')
  EOF
  ```【smoke_import†L1-L1】
- ✅ Validation that README renders without breaking code (visual check).
- ⚠️ Attempts to run `pytest tests/brokers` did not collect tests under the current pytest wrapper (local collection skip issue).
